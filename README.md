### The use of these tools is to make it easier to run servers.

As some of us know, when starting a modded server within dayz or arma, we often have the issue of needing to list every mod in our preset for the server to run modded.

Now that issue is no more, these scripts (Both for Windows and Linux) Will take the input of a mod preset in their classic .html format, and will output all the mods in said list, into a simple text file.

```
Installation is easy, just download the latest update, run the script based on your system
Linux/MacOS=.sh
Windows=.ps1
Respectively, and simply choose the preset you want to have a list/output of.
```

I hope this tool helps you as much as it is me currently, I know it isn't much, but it's something.
